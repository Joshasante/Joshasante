									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Joshasante/Portfolio-Project-2-Queries/blob/main/23.5.5%20Nashville%20Housing%20Queries.sql">Data Cleaning in Sql<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this Project, I used SQL to sanitize and refine housing data. This Housing data contained several inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates and errors. SQL offered me powerful tools that made me clean the data by removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and identifying and correcting errors in the data. To satisfy the client request by performing a detailed data analysis, I needed to integrate different datasets by combining or merging them based on common fields or keys, ensuring consistency and coherence in the final dataset. These tasks were all executed with SQL queries.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Joshasante/Portforlio-Project-1-Queries" class="image fit"><img src="images/Covid 19.jfif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I extracted Covid19 Data from the WHO and cleaned it to enable me begin my analysis by calculating summary statistics such as the total number of cases, deaths, and infection count. I explored the data geographically to understand continent and regional variations. I grouped the data by country and analyzed metrics such as infection rates and vaccinations.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Joshasante/Excel-Project-1" class="image fit"><img src="images/Visualisation.jfif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A client needed to understand which products to discontinue among the many products due to the impact of covid19. She needed a simple visualization and data interpretation to arrive at a decision. I used formulas and pivot tables in excel to generate a simple dashboard that made this client arrive at a decision. The analysis also drew focus on best performing sales teams across the countries that it operated.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Joshasante/Excel-Project-2" class="image fit"><img src="images/Road Accident.jfif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I used Data reported from the Department of Transport in Britain to explore correlations between different variables in the dataset. I investigated the relationship between road accidents and factors like road conditions, road type, light conditions and by location/area. I also analyzed the monthly trends for 2021 and 2022. I added url to the dashboard to provide easy navigation. This correlation analysis helped identify factors that contribute to accidents or uncover potential risk factors.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Joshasante/Power-BI/blob/main/A%26J%20Data.pbix" class="image fit"><img src="images/Sales.jfif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I analyzed the sales performance by visualizing key metrics such as total sales, sum of amount and total number of boxes sold. I created interactive charts, graphs, and tables to compare sales performance across different countries and sale persons. I utilized the forecasting algorithms available in Power BI to predict future sales based on historical data.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Joshasante/Power-BI-2" class="image fit"><img src="images/HR Data.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this HR Data, I looked at the rate of attrition within a company which has a history of high job turnover. I assessed whether there is a relationship between attrition and employee performance ratings using heatmaps. I observed the relationship between an employeeâ€™s education level and attrition rate. I visualized the attrition rate by gender for different Age Group to ascertain the group with the most level of attrition. I used slicer to see the direction of the analysis based on the education profile of the staff.</p>
